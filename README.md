## Requirements

- Silverstripe ^4.0
- dynamic/silverstripe-country-dropdown-field ^1.0

- guzzlehttp/guzzle ^7.4
- php-http/guzzle7-adapter ^1.0
- php-http/message ^1.13

## Installation

`composer require dynamic/silverstripe-geocoder`

## License

See [License](license.md)

## Example usage

### Getting Started

in `mysite/_config/config.yml`, apply the DataExtensions to your DataObject:
```yaml
SilverStripe\ORM\DataObject:
  extensions:
    - Dynamic\SilverStripeGeocoder\AddressDataExtension
    - Dynamic\SilverStripeGeocoder\DistanceDataExtension
```

### Google API Keys

You'll also need to set two API keys. Each key needs to have specific API libraries enabled:
* `geocoder_api_key`
  * Geocoding API
* `map_api_key`
  * Maps JavaScript API
  *  Maps Static API

This is primarily due to the restriction rules on Google API keys. The Geocoding key should be tied to the webserver's public IP, while the Maps API needs to be restricted to the website's domain name.
Restriction rules help to prevent unauthorized users to use your keys, which can quickly use up your API requests quota.

```yaml
Dynamic\SilverStripeGeocoder\GoogleGeocoder:
  geocoder_api_key: 'your-key-here'
  map_api_key: 'your-key-here'
```

## Documentation

### AddressDataExtension
The AddressDataExtension adds `Address`, `Address2`, `City`, `State`, `PostalCode`, `Country`, `Lat`, and `Lng` fields.
The `Lat` and `Lng` fields are read only in the cms and are automatically generated on write.
Geocoding can be disabled on a model basis by setting `disable_geocoding` to true.

```yml
SilverStripe\ORM\DataObject:
    disable_geocoding: true
```

#### Static Map Image

Using `$AddressMap` in a template will render the map.
`$AddressMap` also has options to easily modify the width, height, and scale of the map. `$AddressMap(320, 240, 1)`

##### Map Style

The map can be styled by adding a `mapStyle.json` in any of the following folders in a theme:
```
client/dist/js/
client/dist/javascript/
dist/js/
dist/javascript/
src/javascript/thirdparty
js/
javascript/
```

Styles can be generated using an online service like [Styling Wizard: Google Maps APIs](https://mapstyle.withgoogle.com/)

##### Marker Image
**This does not work on local due to google needing to download the image off the server.**

A custom marker image can be used to match the style of the map in about the same way as the style.
An image named `mapIcon` with an extension of `png`, `jpg`, `jpeg`, or `gif` can be put in any of the following folders in a theme:
```
client/dist/img/
client/dist/images/
dist/img/
dist/images/
img/
images/
```

### DistanceDataExtension
The DistanceDataExtension should be used in conjunction with the AddressDataExtension.
The only time it is viable by itself is if the extended DataObject has `Lat` and `Lng` fields.

The DistanceDataExtension will add a pseudo field for distance away from an address to a DataObject.
The address to check the distance to is from the current controller initially.
This can be changed by implementing `updateAddressValue($address)` on the DataObject or an extension.

```php
/**
 * Always get the distance from Neuschwanstein Castle
 */
public function updateAddressValue(&$address) {
    $address = 'Neuschwansteinstra√üe 20, 87645 Schwangau, Germany';
}
```
